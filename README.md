# MachineLearningCourse
I will be implementing Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course in Python rather than Octave from Standford's ML course.
Please note that notebooks are to illustrate the steps of the exercises, most of the functions are in the respective
Python scripts. 

## A note on certain libraries
You will see that I make use of the **importlib** library, I used it mostly when I make changes to the scripts and want
the changes to be available in the notebooks. Please feel free to comment those out.

I used the Path library to avoid having the data files on the same folder of my notebooks (this is just a preference).
When you download the notebooks, please change the Path instance accordingly or delete it completely if files
are in the same location as the notebooks.

## Note on updates
I will update this repository on the go, please use it as a reference after completing your assignments. Also, understand
the course lectures prior to reading the code in this repository so it makes sense.
